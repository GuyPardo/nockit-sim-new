function [graph_data] = process_graph(G)
% written by guy 2020_10_27. pre processing of a directed graph G
% this function recives a digraph object G and returns a struct graph_data
% with the following fields:
    %     nodes_num = number of nodes in the graph edge_num= gnumber of edges
    %     on the graph 
    %     L_arr = a vector of length edge_num storing the lengths of the edges
    %     v_ph_arr =  a vector of length edge_num storing the phase
    %     velocities
    %     Y_arr = a vector of length edge_num storing the characteristic admittances of the edges
    %     BC_arr = a vectorof length edge_num storing the boundary condition value of each edges
    %     according to the following convetion:
            % 1 - set t to 0
            % 2 - set r to 0
            % 3 - set t to 1
            % 4 - set r t0 1
    %    outedges_cell = a cell array of length node_num where the ith cell is a
    %    collum vector containing the indices of the out-going edges of the ith
    %    nodes
    %    inedges_cell = similarly for in going edges.
    %
    % the input digraph G has to have the folowing edge properties:
    % L - length of the edge
    % v_ph - phase velocity
    % Y - characteristic admittance
    % BC - boundary conditions according the the convention above
    %
